Data Source: [Loan Stats 2019 Q1](https://github.com/monsecc01/Credit_Risk_Analysis/blob/44a5453f2e05c9d584e759eba15b3a0a1a49089a/LoanStats_2019Q1.zip)

Software: Jupyter Notebook, Python, Anaconda Navigator

## Overview of the analysis: 

Explain the purpose of this analysis.

## Results: 
Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

  ### RandomOverSampler Model
  * Balanced Accuracy Scores: Approximately 66%.
  * Precision Scores: High risk precision is only 1% with 63% sensitivity, which provides an F1 of 1%.
  * Recall Scores: Due to the high number of low risk, the sensitivity is 66%.
